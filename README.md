Exploratory Data Analysis on the categorical and continuous data for lung function decline prediction. 


This notebook contains the Explanatory Data Analysis phase on medical data for the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Kaggle competition.

The aim of this competition is to predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.
